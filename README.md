“Automated Text Classification of Economic News Article”
Using:Python, Google Colab, Scikit-learn, NLTK, TensorFlow
Using NLP and machine learning, an automated system for classifying economic news was developed. Preprocessing the data, extracting TF-IDF features, and training models (Decision Trees, SVM, and Logistic Regression) were all part of the procedure. Accuracy and AUC ratings were enhanced by oversampling, with significant performance improvements seen in SVM and Logistic Regression.
